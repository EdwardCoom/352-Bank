# CW 13: Unit Testing in C#

Name: Zach Coomer

Date: 04/24/2023

## Description

This is a unit testing lab, that uses a C# program Bank linked to a Bank Test program. When used in conjunction, Bank Test has unit tests that check if certain function operations produce expected results from the Bank program.

## Challenges

* Understanding what type of exceptions is the only challenge I faced, due to lack of experience with them.

## Design Decisions

* Design decisions reflect the assignment [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VIoAcrfV9YlHZ8sNA8xPEqkKMmV_pqZ6pm4Q5_vOjUY/pub) which is based on [the MSDN Unit Test walkthrough](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2015/test/walkthrough-creating-and-running-unit-tests-for-managed-code?view=vs-2015&redirectedfrom=MSDN).

## Files Required

* Bank\Class1.cs
	- The BankAccount Class that holds information for how the functions operate, the class that is being tested.

* BankTest\UnitTest1.cs
	- The Unit Test class that tests the BankAccount Class.

* README.md
	- Here I list brief information about the program and topics related to the program.

## How to Run

This program is currently intended to be run in Visual Studios 2022.

To run the Unit Tests, Select `Test` at the top of Visual Studios and then `Run All Tests`.
